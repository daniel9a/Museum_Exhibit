            Coinciding with the opening of Bruce Nauman’s (MFA ’66, UC Davis)
            retrospective at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, this exhibition
            features the first realization of a participatory environment Nauman
            conceived in 1970. The work is a narrow passageway that wraps around
            an existing room, combining colored fluorescent light and
            closed-circuit video to manipulate the viewer’s perceptual
            experience. An adjacent gallery includes artworks that situate the
            corridor within the artist’s career.

              Few living artists have done as much to expand the boundaries of
              art since 1960 as Bruce Nauman. During the mid-late 1960s -
              beginning with his time as a graduate student in the UC Davis
              studio art program, where he received his MA in 1966 - Nauman was
              at the forefront of a generation of artists that placed process
              and activity over static, predetermined forms, and that took up
              language and the body as materials. Unbound by traditional
              divisions of medium, Nauman has moved freely between sculpture,
              performance, film, video, photography, drawing, printmaking, and
              large-scale installation.

              This exhibition coincides with a major Nauman retrospective,
              co-organized by The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and the Schaulager
              Basel, the artist's first in over twenty years. While the
              retrospective provides an opportunity to survey the full breadth
              of Nauman's work, the present exhibition at the Manetti Shrem
              Museum focuses on a single, exceptional artwork: a large-scale
              participatory environment from 1970-71. Between 1969 and 1976,
              Nauman designed some forty corridors, rooms, and other
              architectural installations. The majority of these installations
              have been built for exhibition on at least one occasion, but Blue
              and Yellow Corridor is one of a handful that have remained on
              paper, in the form of drawings by the artist. Although Nauman
              originally developed the concept for this particular work in three
              drawings of 1970-1971, this exhibition represents the first time
              that the installation has actually been realized.
